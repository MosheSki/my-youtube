# My Youtube

Dive into my latest project, a client-side YouTube clone packed with exciting features. Using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, I've crafted an immersive experience. Harnessing live YouTube APIs, I've integrated real-time features like live chat using long polling and nested comment replies. Plus, enjoy seamless searching with debouncing and efficient cache updates to minimize API calls.
